* @brief Temperature Example Application main file.
* @details
* This file contains the source code for a sample application using the temperature sensor.
* This contains workaround for PAN_028 rev2.0A anomalies 28, 29,30 and 31. PAN 43 is not covered.
*  - PAN_028 rev2.0A anomaly 28 - TEMP: Negative measured values are not represented correctly
*  - PAN_028 rev2.0A anomaly 29 - TEMP: Stop task clears the TEMP register.
*  - PAN_028 rev2.0A anomaly 30 - TEMP: Temp module analog front end does not power down when DATARDY event occurs.
*  - PAN_028 rev2.0A anomaly 31 - TEMP: Temperature offset value has to be manually loaded to the TEMP module
*  - PAN_028 rev2.0A anomaly 43 - TEMP: Using PPI between DATARDY event and START task is not functional.
